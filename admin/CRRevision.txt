JSON-LD 1.1
W3C Candidate Recommendation 02 March 2020

This version:
     https://www.w3.org/TR/2020/CR-json-ld11-20200305/
Latest published version:
     https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/

Abstract:
JSON is a useful data serialization and messaging format. This specification defines JSON-LD 1.1, a JSON-based format to serialize Linked Data. The syntax is designed to easily integrate into deployed systems that already use JSON, and provides a smooth upgrade path from JSON to JSON-LD. It is primarily intended to be a way to use Linked Data in Web-based programming environments, to build interoperable Web services, and to store Linked Data in JSON-based storage engines.

This specification describes a superset of the features defined in JSON-LD 1.0 [JSON-LD10] and, except where noted, documents created using the 1.0 version of this specification remain compatible with JSON-LD 1.1.

JSON-LD 1.1 Processing Algorithms and API
W3C Candidate Recommendation 02 March 2020

This version:
     https://www.w3.org/TR/2020/CR-json-ld11-api-20200305/
Latest published version:
     https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11-api/

Abstract:
This specification defines a set of algorithms for programmatic transformations of JSON-LD documents. Restructuring data according to the defined transformations often dramatically simplifies its usage. Furthermore, this document proposes an Application Programming Interface (API) for developers implementing the specified algorithms.

This specification describes a superset of the features defined in JSON-LD 1.0 Processing Algorithms And API [JSON-LD10-API] and, except where noted, the algorithms described in this specification are fully compatible with documents created using JSON-LD 1.0 [JSON-LD10].
