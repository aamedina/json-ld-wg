Philippe, Ralph,

the AC Review for the JSON-LD 1.0 Superseded Recommendations:

https://www.w3.org/2002/09/wbs/33280/jsonld10-sup/

have ended yesterday. All (24) reviews are in favor of publishing the Superseded Recommendations. Do I have your approval to go ahead?

FYI, the publication is planned for the 3rd of November.

Thanks

Ivan
