Denis,

This is an official publication request for the publication of two Superseded Recommendations on behalf of the JSON-LD Working Group. The publication date is the 3rd of November, 2020. The three documents are:

- JSON-LD 1.0
	https://www.w3.org/TR/2020/SPSD-json-ld-20201103/
- JSON-LD 1.0 Processing Algorithms and API
	https://www.w3.org/TR/2020/SPSD-json-ld-api-20201103/

These documents have already been installed; they have been edited based on the original Recommendations and modified following the guidelines of Philippe.

Xueyuan, I will send you a separate mail on the draft announcements for the 3rd.

Thanks!

Ivan
