Dear Advisory Committee Representative,
Chairs,

It is my pleasure to announce that JSON-LD 1.0 and JSON LD 1.0 API are now a W3C Superseded Recommendations:
   
   https://www.w3.org/TR/2020/SPSD-json-ld-20201103/
   https://www.w3.org/TR/2020/SPSD-json-ld-api-20201103/


Both documents are Superseded Recommendations because newer specifications exists, namely:

    https://www.w3.org/TR/2020/REC-json-ld11-20200716/
    https://www.w3.org/TR/2020/REC-json-ld11-api-20200716/


These newer documents provide 1.0 compatibility. They are recommended for new adoption in place of the 1.0 specification. Implementers and users should refer to the newer versions of the specifications.

The AC review for this publication was unanimously in favor.

Please join us in congratulating the W3C JSON-LD Working Group [2] on this achievement.

This announcement follows section 7.1.2 of the W3C Process Document:
