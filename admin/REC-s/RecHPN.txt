Subject: [DRAFT HPN] Candidate Recommendations published for JSON-LD 1.1

----------------------------

<p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/2018/json-ld-wg/">JSON-LD Working Group</a> has just published a Recommendations for three documents, namely:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2020/REC-json-ld11-20200716/">JSON-LD 1.1</a>—This specification defines JSON-LD 1.1, a JSON-based format to serialize Linked Data. The syntax is designed to easily integrate into deployed systems that already use JSON, and provides a smooth upgrade path from JSON to JSON-LD. It is primarily intended to be a way to use Linked Data in Web-based programming environments, to build interoperable Web services, and to store Linked Data in JSON-based storage engines.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2020/REC-json-ld11-api-20200716/">JSON-LD API</a>—This specification defines a set of algorithms for programmatic transformations of JSON-LD documents. Restructuring data according to the defined transformations often dramatically simplifies its usage. Furthermore, this document proposes an Application Programming Interface (API) for developers implementing the specified algorithms.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2020/REC-json-ld11-api-20200716/">JSON-LD 1.1 Framing</a>—JSON-LD Framing allows developers to query by example and force a specific tree layout to a JSON-LD document.</li>
</ul>
