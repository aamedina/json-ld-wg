[DRAFT] JSON_LD 1.1 are W3C Recommendations 
-------------------------------------------


Dear Advisory Committee Representative,
Chairs,

It is my pleasure to announce that Trace Context is now a W3C Recommendation::

JSON-LD 1.1
	https://www.w3.org/TR/2020/REC-json-ld11-20200716/

JSON-LD 1.1 Processing Algorithms and API
	https://www.w3.org/TR/2020/REC-json-ld11-api-20200716/

JSON-LD 1.1 Framing
	https://www.w3.org/TR/2020/REC-json-ld11-api-20200716/
    

This specification defines JSON-LD 1.1, a JSON-based format to serialize Linked Data. The syntax is designed to easily integrate into deployed systems that already use JSON, and provides a smooth upgrade path from JSON to JSON-LD. It is primarily intended to be a way to use Linked Data in Web-based programming environments, to build interoperable Web services, and to store Linked Data in JSON-based storage engines. This version of the specification describes a superset of the features defined in JSON-LD 1.0 and, except where noted, documents created using the 1.0 version of this specification remain compatible with JSON-LD 1.1.

Most Members who responded to the Call for Review [1] of the Proposed Recommendation showed support or abstained. One member opposed the publication but did not raise a formal objection while two members raised formal objections. The issue that led to these objections was common to all three comments and concerned the relationships of JSON-LD and the run-time environments of browsers. The Working Group made some last minute technical changes on the document that addressed these issues adequately.

Please join us in congratulating the W3C JSON-LD Working Group [2] on this achievement.

Thank you,

For Tim Berners-Lee, Director, and
Philippe Le HÃ©garet, Project Management Lead;
Xueyuan Jia, W3C Marketing & Communications
