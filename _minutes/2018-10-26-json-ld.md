> *Benjamin Young:* white board from this morning:
> ![white board content](https://www.w3.org/2018/10/ericp_example_1.jpg)
> 

**Eric Prud'hommeaux:** the issue to talk about api#26 ...  

**Eric Prud'hommeaux:** ... Gregg wrote it up. The issue is for `@container: @graph` — this property creates a blank node that ends up being a graph name for the embedded triples.  
… so if we look at something without `@graph`, and we have a tree like [...], we could access it like var.input.value  
… In triples it turns into a graph `b0 foo:input b1 ; b1 foo:value "x"`  
… We could get that with a graph path similar to the code  
… Which is the same as the sparql `?a foo:input ?b ; ?b foo:value ?v`  
… In my proposal, If you create a graph it still ends up traversable  
… but currently we end up with `b0 input b1 ; b2:value "x"` — it's disconnected  
… The things we normally use to get around don't work  

**Adam Soroka:** We need to make the bnodes the same?  

**Eric Prud'hommeaux:** Yes. We would otherwise need higher level logic to merge them  
… but we could just re-use the bnode  
… this was used for verifiable claims. The bit that was in the input was only a tiny bit of stuff. So warlking around in a large graph looking for a triple was easy as the wrapper was very small, but that isn't always the case  
… you would also otherwise need application level logic, or you can't query  
… to traverse the data, you need to know it's valid  

**Adam Soroka:** And hence ShEX issues  

**Eric Prud'hommeaux:** Yes, or SPARQL queries.  

**Eric Prud'hommeaux:** The downside is that the blank node is the name of the graph, and a node in the outer graph  
… this could be the default behavior. There might be other ways to connect them in the future  
… need to get the same level of access in the RDF as in the JSON  
… one more thing, the way to connect the nodes with more configuration and more of a pain, one construct is to say that b1 has a focus of b2  
… that has a lot of reuse, but would mean writing into the rdf namespace  
… e.g. in clinical data. Here's a pairing of a graph name and a focus node  

**Eric Prud'hommeaux:** Objection is typically that if there's a property, is it about the graph or about the node  

**Gregg Kellogg:** implies the name of the graph has meaning  

**Eric Prud'hommeaux:** Yes, but it's a blank node  
… but what happens if it has `@id`? I think the answer there is both a node name and a graph name  

**Rob Sanderson:** What's the range of `foo:input`?  

**Eric Prud'hommeaux:** union of named graph and the graph node class  
… which doesn't bother logicians, but does bug engineers  

**Gregg Kellogg:** Not the use of every graph container  
… where the graph appears with the value of a statement and doesn't have their own declarative statement  
… should we just use the graph name as the subject in that case  
… which would allow for the follow your nose  

**Eric Prud'hommeaux:** everything inside the input, all of those triples have the same subject  

**Adam Soroka:** Trying to think of situations where I would want either way  

**Gregg Kellogg:** You could just declare the subject  

**Benjamin Young:** That maps cleanly to the expection when used — once typed out I expect it to work like that  
… to end up detached would be bad.  
… it breaks round tripping.  
… there's times when you use @graph like a packaging format  
… here's a bundle of stuff  

**Adam Soroka:** as Gregg says in that case put in an explicit subject  

**Benjamin Young:** In `@container: @graph` the implication is that they're connected  
… once you lose that, you'd just stay in JSON  

**Rob Sanderson:** so the proposal is that for `@container: @graph`, when the subject is not explicitly set, then the default is to reuse the blank node  

**Ivan Herman:** I have a more general uncomfortable feeling. We introduce another micro-rule. They all make sense by themselves, but when you pile them up you get a language that's diifficult to understand  
… we don't take a simpler approach  

**Eric Prud'hommeaux:** It seems the argument is more persuasive in the other direction  

**Ivan Herman:** I don't go into the particular issue, but that we just got as a proposal — if this and that and that, then ...  
… this is the proposal, it's not a straightforward thing  
… this is what I don't like  
… we pile up lots of these things and end up very complex.  
… We should talk about URI resolution. e.g. with vocab and this and that. 90% of the people on the call didn't follow what Gregg was explaining  
… not anything wrong with what Gregg says, the reasoning steps are all okay by themselves, it's the overall thing that becomes complicated  
… the containers in 1.0 were used only for one thing, now we add a lot more  
… we continue to do that. Don't want to get to the technical details for this issue, just at the overall pattern  

**Eric Prud'hommeaux:** I think the argument here is that the status quo is harder to explain, more surprising  

**Benjamin Young:** Current situation is accidental.  
… this proposal seems more natural  

**Adam Soroka:** there's some tension between avoiding surprise and keeping things easy to learn. In this case there is complexity, but its less surprising  

**Ivan Herman:** As a zero level question, why do we need the container graph?  
… Some community needs something, so we add a new quirk  

**Benjamin Young:** `@graph` gets everyone's hackles up. So we got `@container: @graph`  
… from a JSON developer's perspective, they need tools to get from the tree to the graph structure  
… need to not annoy both groups  
… this one to me resolves an issue from the RDF side  

> *Benjamin Young:* [https://w3c.github.io/json-ld-syntax/#ex-85-implicitly-named-graph](https://w3c.github.io/json-ld-syntax/#ex-85-implicitly-named-graph)

**Simon Steyskal:** Going through the spec, in example 85, for graph containers. I wasn't sure about the original sample  
… it shows two graph objects, but if you look at the statements in the playground, it's not what the original version has. They don't match the expanded version in the spec  
… the playground already does this reuse  

**Adam Soroka:** People might be reliant on the feature?  

**Rob Sanderson:** what does the spec say now?  

**Gregg Kellogg:** it makes you create a new blank node  

**Ivan Herman:** I repeat what I said in the issue comments :-( From a point of view of consistent view of how JSON-LD behaves, what is done today is the right thing to do  
… the various things that a container contains is pieces of graphs. Inside is different nodes. So reusing the same bnode internally and for the graph, I understand it's handy, but it does not fit the model for the JSON-LD world  
… we could hack it around with a micro-rule, but from a JSON-LD consistency PoV it's not right  
… not a formal objection but I disagree  

**Adam Soroka:** There's a lot of opportunities — there's other ways to do it  

**Eric Prud'hommeaux:** If you could parameterize the behavior and let the user decide whether they get this behavior or the other  

**Ivan Herman:** We have the syntax in the example. We can name the bnode explicitly  

**Gregg Kellogg:** what does container: graph mean? You're putting a box around some of the information so that it's part of a separate graph.  
… but it means that input has a value that is a named graph.  

**Ivan Herman:** That's what it means  

**Adam Soroka:** You're right, but eric is not asking to uniformly conflate them  

**Ivan Herman:** then a separate syntax?  
… we would have two types of containers, one graph container behaves as it should, and another that does something extra  
… it pulls in the name into the internals of the graph  

**Adam Soroka:** It's a very common idiom  

**Ivan Herman:** I understand. The problem is that we always follow perfectly valid rules, but we need to look at the overall result  
… for many people JSON-LD is very scary because it's so complicated  

**Eric Prud'hommeaux:** But has better adoption  

**Ivan Herman:** we do something very strange — and maybe we need to acknowledge it — we work with people from all corners of JSON usage and try to push them into the linked data world  
… so you might lose the LD people as JSON-LD becomes an incredible mess  
… you have people working with patterns of usage, but if I come from the LD world and just want to use JSON-LD as a serialization, and I know what I'm doing, then for me the usage is very complicated  
… I don't think in the fixed patterns, I just want to put a graph and get unexpected results  

**Eric Prud'hommeaux:** In this case you have a disconnected graph, and you can do that with the expanded form  

> *Rob Sanderson:* [... more similar discussion ...]

**Rob Sanderson:** So the alternate would be to have an explicit link. Would that be automatic, or put into the data?  

**Gregg Kellogg:** I don't think you can have the named graph in the source and the graph?  
… within the named graph you have a triple whose subject is the graph  
… can create a statement with a blank node, and the meaning lies with the predicate  
… would not want to automatically introduce it  

**Eric Prud'hommeaux:** When you have a graph that has two of those, what does it mean?  
… it's unattractive, and I've done it but was an interim measure  

**Gregg Kellogg:** if we keep the status quo, and the name of the graph is not visible, the implications for writing a shape for trying to match things  

**Eric Prud'hommeaux:** THere's a step where you collect things. But when you get to the internal graph you've already collected it. You'd need to do cycles of gathering and validating  
… without some predictable connection, there isn't a way to do it without a procedural language  

**Adam Soroka:** You have to assume validity in order to validate it  

**Eric Prud'hommeaux:** Can do various things  

**Adam Soroka:** But it's application level knowledge  

**Eric Prud'hommeaux:** Yes, you'd have to customize a lot of stuff  
… here you do an unbound sparql query  
… which is considerably more expensive  

**Adam Soroka:** you still might need to apply application knowledge  

**Eric Prud'hommeaux:** Could find nodes that don't have inbound links, but you can't assume that's always the case with inverse properties etc  

**Rob Sanderson:** (restates problem)  

**Ivan Herman:** It comes from `@container: @graph`. As a value, I have an object whose keys refer to something specific  
… a language refers to the language of the string  
… but the graphs are very different beasts. They must have an identifier, or we generate them one  
… it's different from language, so maybe the container model is not fit for that purpose  
… we must talk about identifiers and how they're used elsewhere  
… when I use the container for a language, it's simple  
… it's by the natural language  
… container is a way to categorize certain things, and they become keys  
… I have a bunch of strings with a category, the language  
… I create an object that uses the category as a term  

**Adam Soroka:** Containers as maps  

**Gregg Kellogg:** Not all though  

**Ivan Herman:** Yes, `@container: @list` is a very different animal  

**Eric Prud'hommeaux:** Not that it's a graph, just the container  
… if you want to build a named graph then have a different construct  

**Gregg Kellogg:** Can have a map of graphs with `@id`  
… an array of keys  

**Ivan Herman:** should take a step back to look at containers and mapping  
… is it possible to have a clearer model and separate the two things  
… and then come back to it if there's a more natural way to model it  
… if it's a blank node, then I can assign and reuse  
… user has the choice to reuse.  

**Gregg Kellogg:** If you use a graph id map, then they have to name them explicitly  
… VC and WoT are in a similar situation, I think  

**Ivan Herman:** Yes, but do we now add another special quirk??  

**Adam Soroka:** Depends how many people are interested in it  

**Ivan Herman:** Then we need a template language  
… Propose to leave this alone for a little and look at containers in general  

**Adam Soroka:** And "path" is in here too now (see discussions with WoT), for things people are asking for  

**Ivan Herman:** Could use different term, they're not containers like list or set  

**Gregg Kellogg:** Could introduce `@map`  

**Ivan Herman:** and then add in obsolete terms for indexing  

**Adam Soroka:** Seeing patterns, and then clarifying how to get them into the syntax  
… hence microrules  

**Gregg Kellogg:** Also about the interpretation of the value space  

**Rob Sanderson:** Exactly equivalent to https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/77  

**Gregg Kellogg:** raising warnings :(  and makes algorithms harder  

**Rob Sanderson:** priority of constituencies puts algorithms very close to the bottom  

**Ivan Herman:** Can have a raise warning or not flag in the API  
… algorithms will be slightly more complicated, but only affect 5 or 6 people  

**Adam Soroka:** And we probably know most of them  

**Eric Prud'hommeaux:** Regardless of how you construct the syntax, need to deal with nesting in JSON  

**Gregg Kellogg:** There's the expectation of connectivity  

**Eric Prud'hommeaux:** Relatively simplisitic user, but that's typical. If it's more nuanced, I want the default to not produce pathological graphs  

**Gregg Kellogg:** If we created a new `@map` thing and put graph / id maps in there, so would have a reduced use case for `@container`, and we're back to the same issue  
… container is a graph, and you're in an implicitly named graph. Now where are the rest of the things?  

**Adam Soroka:** syntactic mechanism. If containers were minimized, could be nicer.  If we could add metadata to containers, we could maybe add the information. But would need very strong notion of containers  

**Eric Prud'hommeaux:** That's a step in the right direction  
… trying to deal with existing sem web ... two camps. People who abuse the node to be the graph name. And then there's people who keep them separate.  
… but theres a mechanism to connect them  
… trick is normally HTTP fragments. Use the # and then HTTP connects them  
… those two camps are not going to come together  
… at least half the people are going to be miffed  
… so putting in controls will help  

**Ivan Herman:** more inclined to look at something more complicated, but long term more powerful, and accept that we need a transformation / template language  

**Ivan Herman:** We see a user community that uses a template as that's how they think. We try to come up with syntactic quirks so the templates fit in the model  
… that's where we get in trouble. If we had some transformation language, it could help.  
… not sure it's realistic, and not familiar with framing details  
… can that be added to framing model? Not a rec, so don't have backward compatibility restriction  
… if we do something there, that would mean a cleaner separation  
… if this is taken up by a frame and uses the same bnode.  Can express it in JSON-LD. It's all doable already.  

**Eric Prud'hommeaux:** have about 100 hours thinking on this in ShEX. Both dealing with a case where there's an algorithmic mapping between a graph node and a node in the graph  
… need to get from one to the other  
… expressivity we discovered we needed was at a minimum to chop off or add a hash based identifier  
… for the range 14 folks  
… ability to say it's the same  
… and then as you work down into the people who have pipeline techniques, you end up with regexps  
… that lets you use node identifiers that are relative to the base  
… two nodes that are different but related  
… regexs look at the graph labels  
… to deal with existing data  
… question is how much you want RDF data to drive this.  

**Adam Soroka:** And the other extreme is JSON devs who are told they have to do something. Some things don't make any sense at one or the other end of the spectrum

### 2. Disambiguate uses of @type #77
{: #section2}

> *Simon Steyskal:* link: [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/77](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/77)

**Ivan Herman:** can `@container` be used with `@type` to separate string, dates, etc?  
… if so that is again an argument to deconflate all the meanings of `@container`  

**Gregg Kellogg:** might make sense but isn't very useful  
… the datatype for all variations would be rdf:HTML, so you wouldn't be able to also work by languages  

**Ivan Herman:** right. but even gkellogg had to think about whether you _can_ use `@type` with `@container`, which tells us that we need to simplify  
… a container-mapping for `@dataype` — it's not clear whether it would be useful  

**Rob Sanderson:** if `rdf:Literal` is the datatype...  
… if you had some HTML, some strings, maybe you can sort it out then  

**Ivan Herman:** so mapping via datatype is questionable  

**Gregg Kellogg:** I understand the proposal to be a new keyword `@datatype` to be used in contexts to signal datatypes, as `@type` does today  
… letting us mark that usage of `@type` as obsolete  

**Ivan Herman:** even today, you could use it via aliasing.  

**Gregg Kellogg:** compaction wouldn't do what you want if you did that  

**Ivan Herman:** we have an example from Publishing WG where the alias would be useful, and round tripping not necessary

### 3. allow relative IRIs for @vocab
{: #section3}

> *Simon Steyskal:* link: [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/72](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/72)

**Gregg Kellogg:** in JSON-LD, vocab-relative and document-relative IRIs are resolved differently. we've already looked at this problem  
… and offered the ability to set `@vocab=""`  
… which allows vocab to be resolved against the document base  
… motivated at least in part because in other RDF formats, that distinction doesn't exist  
… so there was a parity issue against other serializations  
… this issue goes further, and lets `@vocab` get set to any relative URI, which would then be evaluated against the document base  
… the proposal includes that if a `@vocab` is already set and a new relative @vocab comes along, one simply string-appends the new one to the old one  

**Rob Sanderson:** in the case of a base that came from HTTP with a # on the end, that would get lost  

**Gregg Kellogg:** this also addresses the problem that Manu raised in the context of blank-node-properties.  

**Rob Sanderson:** if you set vocab to `../#` and you had `example.org/ns` then you get `example.org/ns../#`  

**Ivan Herman:** as an editorial matter we must make very clear that this is string concatenation, not IRI concatenation  

**rob:** are there good rules for determining relative vs. absolute IRIs?  

**Ivan Herman:** Look for the scheme  

**Ivan Herman:** I am almost sure that the URI spec defines that very clearly  

**Rob Sanderson:** but this could be a security problem if a malicious actor sets a CURI prefix of "http" to some malicious address  

**Ivan Herman:** also the same thing with base  

**Gregg Kellogg:** We can't really know  

**Rob Sanderson:** we can just advise people of the security concerns  

> ***Action #1: Rob Sanderson to make a security consideration issue re relative IRI concatenation***
{: #action1 .action}

**Ivan Herman:** do we check for "acceptable" scheme?  
… what about Javascript URIs (bookmarklets)  

> *Rob Sanderson:* "@vocab": "javascript:"

> ***Action #2: Rob Sanderson to create security consideration re javascript URIs and relative IRIs***
{: #action2 .action}

**Gregg Kellogg:** we don't now check for defined schemes  

**Benjamin Young:** it's the responsibility of the document loader to worry about this  
… it could just choose not to resolve troubling URIs  

**Ivan Herman:** so you put together a URI from the JSON-LD (could happen in many ways).  
… at that level, do we add a security check?  

**Benjamin Young:** that's the job of the person using the URI  

> *Rob Sanderson:* Or rather `"@vocab": "javascript:document.alert('hi!');"`

**Benjamin Young:** this isn't a job for the syntax  
… e.g. data: can hide _anything_  
… data: URIs  

**Gregg Kellogg:** this could be used for maliciousness, but it's on the users of the URIs to be careful  

**Rob Sanderson:** we don't do path expansion, we're doing string concat here. so we won't catch a lot of stuff  

**Benjamin Young:** but the advantage of string concat is that it supports non-pathy URIs  

**Gregg Kellogg:** `@vocab` is used only for properties  

**several:** and generally people don't dereference properties, and nothing in our algorithms says that they should  

**Gregg Kellogg:** we can modify the API to return only URIs of some form.  

**Benjamin Young:** we can say "we never use these URIs, so there's no concern w/i JSON-LD, but if users choose to use them, the usual concerns about URIs from the wild apply"  

**Gregg Kellogg:** we might consider softening the current restrictions in 3.6.3  
… to use IRI expansion and not string concatenation  

> *Rob Sanderson:* `"@vocab": "http://example.org/ns/"`  and then `"@vocab": "/"`

> *Rob Sanderson:* currently you get `"http://example.org/ns//"` which is unexpected for relative IRIs

> *Rob Sanderson:* And the expectation would be `"http://example.org/"`

**Ivan Herman:** are we making the distinction between the two kinds of resolution disappear?  

**Gregg Kellogg:** still the issue of concatenation vs. IRI resolution  

**Gregg Kellogg:** how do I establish `@vocab`, vs. how do I use it?  

**Ivan Herman:** if we are in `@vocab` we do string concat, it's clean  
… and users just have to know about that  
… let's don't mingle concatenation and IRI resolution  

**Gregg Kellogg:** we're only interested in resolving `@vocab when it is relative, that's all  

**Ivan Herman:** You're right, but that's about implementing the system  
… I'm talking about end users  
… if we just have string concat for `@vocab`, that's clean, I understand that  
… even if we do IRI resolution instead over here  
… somewhere else. but any problems with doubled slashes, etc., are users problems to deal with  

**Rob Sanderson:** if we went all the way to have @vocab itself computed and vocab terms resolved via IRI resolution, it breaks things  
… so lets stick cleanly to string concatenation  

**Gregg Kellogg:** Ok, but these are different use cases.  

**Ivan Herman:** there is an actual regexp to recognize absolute IRIs, so we can rely on that  

**Harold Solbrig:** doesn't the CURI spec speak to this?  

**Gregg Kellogg:** we don't use CURIEs, either  

**Harold Solbrig:** why are we using something else?  

**Gregg Kellogg:** every RDF serialization uses its own way to discuss short URIs  
… (gkellogg then names more than you would think he could off the top of his head)  

**Rob Sanderson:** we can't necessarily construct all legit IRIs, but most of what we can't is unusual enough not to be problematic  
… if we stick with string concat, we avoid this  
… if you construct stupid `@vocabs`, that's your problem

### 4. expanding `@vocab` properties consistently
{: #section4}

> *Rob Sanderson:* link: [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/56](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/56)

**Gregg Kellogg:** the concern is that the same term expands differently in different places  
… gkellogg then describes the example in the issue  

**Rob Sanderson:** the example has two triples in it:  

> *Benjamin Young:* triples from the playground from the first example in #56

> *Benjamin Young:* `<http://example1.com/barney> <rdf:value> "the sidekick" .`

> *Benjamin Young:* `_:b0 <http://example1.com/fred> <http://example1.com/barney> .`

> *Benjamin Young:* `_:b0 <http://example1.com/fred> <http://example2.com/barney> .`

**Ivan Herman:** I would say that in the second case (barney is a string) it's the defn of barney that comes in  
… nothing to do with that fred is defined by vocab  

**Gregg Kellogg:** no, it does have to do with  
… our rules are intentionally different for different kinds of values  
… the complaint is that the rules for resolving IRIs vary  
… in the example the value space of fred is vocab  
… the fact that there is an entry in the vocab space for barney means nothing when we use barney as an ID.  

> *Adam Soroka:* that's the two different spaces

**Gregg Kellogg:** unless it happens to be used in a CURI  

**Ivan Herman:** this is confusing  

**Gregg Kellogg:** in 1.0 there is a distinction between the vocabulary (properties, types) and values, which come from the document.  
… if you have a term in the vocab with a name that is used as instance data, in each position they are resolved differently.  

> *Benjamin Young:* a remix of the example of #56 using 2 contexts in [http://tinyurl.com/y7wpjogw](http://tinyurl.com/y7wpjogw)

**Gregg Kellogg:** we're getting back into deep history of 1.0 here. Qe felt there are good reasons to make this distinction, but we may have been wrong, of course  

> *Adam Soroka:* ivan is now showing examples on the projector, see [http://tinyurl.com/yclwe2ax](http://tinyurl.com/yclwe2ax)

**Gregg Kellogg:** when you have a doc, you ascribe meaning by bring properties and types to it.  
… but you would want to resolve relative value URIs differently than vocab terms  

**Rob Sanderson:** but this kind of problematic situation shouldn't arise  

**Benjamin Young:** sometimes you don't get a choice  

**Rob Sanderson:** you should be able to avoid it by inverting the order of multiple contexts, if they colliding in this way between them  

**Ivan Herman:** in the first example with barney, `http://example1.com/` is used for base and the first appearance of fred  

**Gregg Kellogg:** the fact that barney is a term in the context doesn't affect value expansion  

**Ivan Herman:** if I change the base, various changes result  
… we could pare down the example  

**Benjamin Young:** this could confuse naive devs  

**Rob Sanderson:** you should never get this to begin with  
… what would be the use of interpreting barney as the same thing in the example  
… you wouldn't construct that data.  

**Benjamin Young:** [uses his hands to construct a list of annotations]  
… one past use case we've gotten is when you start with a list of ids,then you reference down into a list of inclusions.  
… the use case from which this current issue came is gathering that up into a packaged graph with lots of graphs about the same stuff  

> *Rob Sanderson:* [http://tinyurl.com/yb3olq5y](http://tinyurl.com/yb3olq5y)

**Benjamin Young:** in JSON-LD we are constantly using many contexts, that raises the likelihood of this  

> *Adam Soroka:* more discussion about whether or not this situation can realistically arise

**Rob Sanderson:** the data in the OP example is meaningless  

> *Adam Soroka:* ivan brings more examples to the projector

**Ivan Herman:** here is a minimal situation to display the problem  

> *Ivan Herman:* A simpler version of the example:
```json
{
  "@context": {
    "fred": {
      "@id": "http://a.b.c",
      "@type": "@vocab"
    },
    "barney": {

    }
  },
  "fred": "barney"
}
```

*Adam Soroka:* agreement that ivan's new example minimally demonstrates the problem

**Gregg Kellogg:** why does one want to create terms with `'@type':"@vocab"` to begin with?  

**Ivan Herman:** we should have a very clear example of this and explanation of this in the docs  

**Gregg Kellogg:** I think we have examples  

**Ivan Herman:** with lots of explanation  

**Gregg Kellogg:** we have a document space and a vocab space, and the only time document terms get resolved in vocab space is in compact IRIs  
… and when the term used as the property is defined as `'@type':"@vocab"`  

**Benjamin Young:** this example wasn't contrived—it came out of extant tooling  

> *Adam Soroka:* disagreement about how responsible users are to avoid these kinds of colisions when using other people context's

**Ivan Herman:** Patrick (the OP) is a very expert user. What about the less-expert users?  
… it's a return to what I earlier said: what if I am semweb literate, and I come to this, and I can't make my graph work sanely in JSON-LD  

**Benjamin Young:** even with Patrick's expertise he hit this problem, and not by trying to develop a curious example  
… it was normal work  

**Gregg Kellogg:** this might stem from divergent missions  
… surprising that someone trying to turn Turtle into JSON-LD doesn't find that obvious  

**Ivan Herman:** might need to push this into the primer  
… the doc as is tried to make it usable for JSON devs  
… we may need to write from the other direction  
… for RDF folks coming to JSON  

**Rob Sanderson:** in Patrick's defense, there is no good example for this  

**Gregg Kellogg:** I can try to write this up  
… one concern: we are still getting to "own" JSON-LD  
… we all need to get to an adequate mastery level to be able to talk about this  
… we could try assigning issues to people who raise them

### 5. joint meeting with the Data Exchange WG
{: #section5}

> *Ivan Herman:* Minutes of the session in the [DXWG Meeting Minutes](https://www.w3.org/2018/10/26-dxwg-minutes.html#x06)

### 6. syntax/#8 - HTTP parameters for specifying context or frame
{: #section6}

> *Benjamin Young:* continuing conversation from #dxwg

**Rob Sanderson:** we can use space separated lists of URIs, so the profile="" parameter can contain both the compaction, etc. defined URIs  
… as well as a JSON-LD context or frame URI  
… however, these URIs might collectively get quite long  

**Adam Soroka:** if you specify a URI don't you want it to be compacted?  

**Rob Sanderson:** it could be a frame  

**Gregg Kellogg:** or a bomb  

**Benjamin Young:** or a cat photo  

**Adam Soroka:** do we want to have a default use like it's assumed it's a context URI?  

**Ivan Herman:** what would this look like in practice?  

**Rob Sanderson:** I'll write it up...one second...  

> *Rob Sanderson:* `ACCEPT: application/ld+json;profile="http://w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld"`

**Rob Sanderson:** this would say, "I want this request compacted according to this context"  

**Gregg Kellogg:** if that JSON-LD URL returns a context  

**Benjamin Young:** don't dereferences things found in profile params  
… because proxies  

**Gregg Kellogg:** right, security concerns/needs should be expressed  

**Benjamin Young:** we used the entire string as the "media type" for Web Annotation  
… with no expressed intent or idea of dereferencing that context URI  

**Adam Soroka:** I'm not too worried about big headers  
… if you're going to be this particular about it, then that's a "cost" you'll face  

**Rob Sanderson:** and the multiple URIs in profile="" is not a problem?  

**Adam Soroka:** no, I think that's fine  

**Rob Sanderson:** if you don't care if you're flattened or compacted, then don't state it and use the context for whichever you're returning  

**Benjamin Young:** is there priority among these strings?  
… or do they just work as flags?  

**Rob Sanderson:** they're just flags  

**Adam Soroka:** do we want q="" parameters for this?  

**Rob Sanderson:** I'd say it's an error condition to have multiple contexts given  

**Benjamin Young:** is the intent to continue--as Web Annotation did--as a single opaque string?  
… or are we switching on each piece?  
… mostly it's a question for me about upgrading existing Web Annotation servers (and the like)  
… so are they opaque "whole" strings? or  are we taking them apart in some way?  

**Rob Sanderson:** so, in the case of compaction at least, we could have a default that maps to compaction  
… which is how profile="" is used in the cases that we know  

**Gregg Kellogg:** are you going to help write these tests?  

**Rob Sanderson:** sure. I'll help write those tests  
… and the paragraph/dependencies  

**Gregg Kellogg:** and at the moment we don't have complete HTTP header tests...but need those  

**Rob Sanderson:** I know someone (bigbluehat) who's done this already  

**Benjamin Young:** we're continuing the Web Annotation validation/testing tooling work at http://annotator.apache.org/  

**Gregg Kellogg:** so, there are a few HTTP tests now  
… they were originally in an .htaccess file  
… but right now it's left up to the implementations to act as if the headers were expressed in the responses or not  
… the test suite should ideally run off a W3C mirror that implement these .htaccess  

**Benjamin Young:** curious which bits you needed in .htaccess  

**Gregg Kellogg:** there's a remote access manifest in the API  

> *Gregg Kellogg:* [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-api/blob/main/tests/remote-doc-manifest.jsonld](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-api/blob/main/tests/remote-doc-manifest.jsonld)

**Gregg Kellogg:** for example https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-api/blob/main/tests/remote-doc-manifest.jsonld#L34  
… this one tests a `application/jldTest` content type  
… which in this case should fail  
… others here deal with redirects  
… also, another for the Link header https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-api/blob/main/tests/remote-doc-manifest.jsonld#L84  
… for all of these we're analyzing the JSON-LD result  
… so we probably want similar ones analyzing the HTTP headers themselves

### 7. Discussions with the TAG representative
{: #section7}

**Rob Sanderson:** We want guidance from TAG because this crosses specs, specs that are at various process stages.  

> *Gregg Kellogg:* [https://github.com/orgs/w3c/projects/4](https://github.com/orgs/w3c/projects/4)

#### 7.1. What is 'base' for an embedded json-ld? (redux)
{: #section7-1}

> *Gregg Kellogg:* [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/23](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/23)

**Rob Sanderson:** the overall req is that for relative URIS, we must have a way to resolve them to absolute URIs.  
… JSON-LD that is provided by itself, this only refers to the URI of the doc.  
… so  resolution is easy.  

**Rob Sanderson:** but you can also embed JSON-LD w/in HTML  
… there are various ways to determine the base of an HTML doc  
… our issue is when we are resolving rel URIs inside a JSON-LD doc inside an HTML doc  
… should we rely on that base or should we rely on the JSON-LD base (as it would otherwise be used)?  

**Ivan Herman:** the base attribute in the DOM is inherited by the ``<script/>`` element that contains the JSON-LD  

**Hadley Beeman:** use case?  

**Ivan Herman:** every schema.org doc (in JSON-LD) is embedded. Billions of pages contain this.  

> *Dan Brickley:* Case 1: [https://gist.github.com/danbri/0168ebcd731493ee88c20407e6cdb8bf](https://gist.github.com/danbri/0168ebcd731493ee88c20407e6cdb8bf) raw: [https://gist.githubusercontent.com/danbri/0168ebcd731493ee88c20407e6cdb8bf/raw/bff3ae0bed3fac72972bf1ccccd4137517111bc4/gistfile1.txt](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/danbri/0168ebcd731493ee88c20407e6cdb8bf/raw/bff3ae0bed3fac72972bf1ccccd4137517111bc4/gistfile1.txt)  HTML includes a div setting a base. vs Case 2: [https://gist.github.com/danbri/b04d835ebf227f8994001b304ac59acf](https://gist.github.com/danbri/b04d835ebf227f8994001b304ac59acf) [https://gist.githubusercontent.com/danbri/b04d835ebf227f8994001b304ac59acf/raw/3cbea88cd905665cd158b5988b1a8839362e4f57/gistfile1.txt](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/danbri/b04d835ebf227f8994001b304ac59acf/raw/3cbea88cd905665cd158b5988b1a8839362e4f57/gistfile1.txt)

> *Dan Brickley:* I forgot to relative-ize some URLs

**Hadley Beeman:** what are you going to do with the absolute URI?  

**Rob Sanderson:** the point is to get to RDF, which works on absolute URI  

**Dan Brickley:** We just want to make links!  

**Benjamin Young:** the dom tree inherits that base tag, and the base tag also supplies the base URI for the HTML doc  
… the prevailing encouragement is to ignore the DOM  

**Rob Sanderson:** the counterexamples are Microdata or RDFa. RDFa uses all the base URIs.  
… they use the DOM, both of them  

**Gregg Kellogg:** it would be nice if all these things agreed  

**Benjamin Young:** we already have explicit base for JSON-LD  

**Hadley Beeman:** how much is JSON-LD content vs. machine-parseable behavior?  
… it's not easy  

**Benjamin Young:** Is the JSON-LD integrated in the doc, or is the doc just a carrier?  

**Gregg Kellogg:** you might have multiple script blocks.  

> *Dan Brickley:* I redid the testcases: [https://gist.github.com/danbri/0168ebcd731493ee88c20407e6cdb8bf](https://gist.github.com/danbri/0168ebcd731493ee88c20407e6cdb8bf) vs [https://gist.github.com/danbri/b04d835ebf227f8994001b304ac59acf](https://gist.github.com/danbri/b04d835ebf227f8994001b304ac59acf) (see raw links for ... raw links)

**Hadley Beeman:** it's content vs. structured data  
… danbri and are have been discussing this  

**Hadley Beeman:** my instinct is to prefer that data that is machine-readable before human-readable shouldn't be tied up with the DOM  
… but I'd like to discuss with my TAG colleagues to avoid breaking other things  

> *Dan Brickley:* 3 points about this

> *Dan Brickley:* 1. Google at least, likely other search engines, extract JSON-LD after running headless browsers.

> *Dan Brickley:* 2. Here's a headless browser called from python (firefox), which ignores `<base href>` and just pulls out ``<script>``. It would be good for this not to get too much more complex.

> *Dan Brickley:* 3. The big appeal of JSON-LD was its standalone nature.

**Benjamin Young:** this might be a good thing for RDF 2.0, but it would not be in a ``<script/>`` tag  
… but a data block right now doesn't inherit from the DOM  

**Hadley Beeman:** if you come from the part of the Web where most stuff is in the DOM, then this would be natural for JSON-LD  
… the desire to integrate in the future makes sense,  
… but not doing that suddenly now  

**Dan Brickley:** 1. we don't want to get involved with browsery hell as a search engine.  
… but what we do now is fragile  
… but it's easy for publishers  
… we say that it works, but we're not pushing it as the right thing to do  
… 2. JSON-LD took off because it was self-contained  
… unlike other structured data formats  
… that self-contained character is the clincher here  
… only do relative URIs if you know what you're doing  

**Gregg Kellogg:** these bleeds into other specs that might use `<script>` blocks  
… how should rel URIs be interpreted there?  
… I suspect that they should be resolved against the document URI  

**Benjamin Young:** same deal if you have a CMS that is sticking metadata into pages—you should absolute-ize the URIs  
… which we can do already in JSON-LD  

> *Hadley Beeman:* Create an issue on this please [https://github.com/w3ctag/design-reviews](https://github.com/w3ctag/design-reviews)

**Gregg Kellogg:** if we have input, we should give that to the TAG  

**Benjamin Young:** could result in changes to the datablock spec  
… or telling specs to advertise what they do here  
… ultimately, if you don't absolutize the URIs, you are entangling your data with the package  

> *Benjamin Young:* [https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/semantics-scripting.html#data-block](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/semantics-scripting.html#data-block)

**Hadley Beeman:** you used the word "package"  

**Benjamin Young:** let me say "conveyance" instead  

> *Dan Brickley:* ..ooOO( if json ld is parsing from a.html and there's an iframe of b.html, ... do we have anything to say?)

**Dan Brickley:** what is the story with multiple script blocks?  

**Benjamin Young:** we have other issues, but without this we can't get to the others  

#### 7.2. Content addressable contexts
{: #section7-2}

**link:** https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/9  

**Rob Sanderson:** equally or more cross-working-group to the last one  
… VC et al have security concerns around contexts that must be led by a server before the server can understand the JSON-LD  

**Benjamin Young:** you don't have to fetch this every time you need it, you will cache contexts, etc.  
… which comes around to how contexts (as web resources) change with time  
… naming on the Web—easy?  
… each of the communities using the tech can resolve these things. we need the TAG to advice on the nuances of things  
… like content hashes, etc.  

**Rob Sanderson:** you can solve it at 3 diff layers: HTTP, where you can last-modified, etags, etc.  
… in the doc itself, which can declare versioning  
… or in the URI, e.g. http/example.com/v2  

**Dan Brickley:** but do you need a context at all?  

**Gregg Kellogg:** you can put it into the instance doc itself, but it still exists.  

> *Benjamin Young:* `{"@context": {"@vocab": "http://example.com/"}, "name": "made up vocab"}`

**Gregg Kellogg:** The notion is that JSON-LD provides the context within which to interpret your JSON  
… strings sometimes are dates sometimes IRIs, sometimes something else  
… you need to both distinguish between these things but also allow for idiomatic JSON  

> *Benjamin Young:* which creates `_:doc-id <http://example.com/name> "made up vocab"` (in triples—where "doc-id" is completely random)

**Gregg Kellogg:** the context explains some of the things that API docs might explain  

**Dan Brickley:** I had thought that the context could be derived in some other way  

**Benjamin Young:** you can.  

> *Adam Soroka:* (from an HTTP header)

> *Dan Brickley:* is this wrong then?

> *Dan Brickley:* `{ "@vocab": "https://schema.org/", "@type": "Volcano", "sameAs": "https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2586153",   "name": "Zuidwal volcano",  "description": "The Zuidwal volcano is an extinct volcano in the Netherlands at more than 2 km (6,600 ft) below ground ..."}`

> *Benjamin Young:* latest syntax spec [https://w3c.github.io/json-ld-syntax/](https://w3c.github.io/json-ld-syntax/)

**Rob Sanderson:** the TAG issue for guidance is — this caching question is much broader that JSON-LD.  
… many systems do this kind of "apply one resource to another to clarify"  
… e.g a CSS stylesheet—if it changes over time the rendered HTML will look very different  
… in a knowledge graph context, that kind of change is much more dangerous  
… guidance for mitigating those concerns in the spec rather than leaving it up to broader discussion about change over time on the web  

> *Benjamin Young:* Link header looks like: `Link: <context.jsonld>; rel="http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context"; type="application/ld+json"`

**Hadley Beeman:** so remote change can affect local things—how is this different from old concerns about linking?  

**Dan Brickley:** the WoT folks chose a syntax that requires this additional context resource—that's what causes this to be different  
… as long as you need the context doc to interpret and act on the data, you have opened this security hole  

**Hadley Beeman:** so what about caching?  

**Adam Soroka:** WoT operates on much longer timescales — years in many cases.  

**Dan Brickley:** one thing we care about is being a planet-scale search engine, the other is about lightbulbs in your home  

**Benjamin Young:** you can't change what happens in the lightbulb without changing the context used for data there  
… you can update when you update the code  
… the URI of the context really is a URI (an identifier), not a location, but it ends up being used as one  

**Hadley Beeman:** I still hear this either being "we have to solve the problems of building the IoT" or "the network knows something about me because of what I looked at"  
… which are both larger problems  

**Dan Brickley:** no, it's different — because now the lightbulb is not a user agent, but it is broadcasting info about you  

**Benjamin Young:** our API spec says you can implement document loading any way you want, yay!  
… but that doesn't really solve the problem  
… we have this elsewhere, e.g. clickjacking  
… the answer is Single Domain policies, which is utterly inflexible and unwebby  
… we want to have ids that can be safely resolved  
… we would like a webby trust model  

**Hadley Beeman:** if we do that, we say this is no longer a user agent (the light bulb)  
… you are making an explicit decision that has privacy remifications—you need to be aware of that  

> *Dan Brickley:* (mitigation sketches being: parser reports, and web packaging for out-of-band context bundles with integrity checks, e.g. via homehubs etc)

**Dan Brickley:** I am unaware of any context that is useful and has gone unchanged for more than a few weeks  
… we're stuck between refreshing and getting the best new stuff  
… and broadcasting your interests on the web  
… but if not, you get out of date  
… one thing would be for parsers to report what they're done  

> *Rob Sanderson:* (and we carry on)

> *Rob Sanderson:* (everyone disagrees about the weeks lifecycle, e.g. activitystreams, annotations, ldp, etc)

**Dan Brickley:** there are a lot of use cases for web packaging, this might connect with that  
… your home env might have gotten this through some kind of bundled thing at lower frequencies.  

**Benjamin Young:** you could have an API for updating the lightbulb  
… but that can't work from  a pull side, because you can't guarantee that the identifier will resolve the same way on the open web over time  
… bringing us to blockchains, hashing, etc.  
… there are lots of potential solutions on the list  
… web packaging is one potential solution  

**Rob Sanderson:** do you understand the issue well enough for us to send a ticket to TAG?  

**Hadley Beeman:** what's the header for this?  

**Benjamin Young:** maybe "integrity"  

**Hadley Beeman:** please write this up with use cases  
… because otherwise we're staying hypothetical  

**Benjamin Young:** there is no requirement to do remote context dereferencing  
… but people will  

**Dan Brickley:** there are the specs, then there are ways you relay operate  
… with JSON-LD, if you do it wrong, people flame you on the mailing list  
… social pressure has forced us to become a component in a larger system—not cool!  

**Dan Brickley:** we'd like people to get what they are expecting when they get contexts  

**Benjamin Young:** many communities have this same problem  
… with many different solutions  
… that's what makes it a TAG deal  
… another big JSON-LD deployment is Mastodon (uses Activity Streams)  

> *Adam Soroka:* .. they haven't updated their context for a long time

**Benjamin Young:** but it still works  
… which is what makes this a Publishing WG problem—publishing that is broken because a system went down somewhere isn't publishing as publishers understand it  

### 8. document loading related proposals
{: #section8}

**Ivan Herman:** I think it's worthwhile to explore an "integrity" expression similar to SRI  
… I don't know how exactly it would be used at the API level  
… I also have the expectation that other attributes with similar intent will come along  
… but I feel that sealing is definitely not one of those  
… and as an aside, our preference is to say that sealing is done within a context file for that context  

**Adam Soroka:** I believe it's only been context files who have asked us for sealing anyhow, is that correct?  

**Ivan Herman:** yes. only context file authors  
… and perhaps we should add to that issue that we could limit sealing to only a context file  
… did we also talk about data documents?  

**Gregg Kellogg:** I believe we talked about both  
… we could do that for a context or a term definition  

**Benjamin Young:** I still feel like this will result in unexpected behavior  

**Adam Soroka:** syntax based security is false security  

**Gregg Kellogg:** I'd just remove the sealed keyword from someone else context file if for some reason I couldn't override it  

**Ivan Herman:** so "sealing" does indeed give one a false sense of security  

**Gregg Kellogg:** in Ruby there are private and protected methods  
… but there's also a send method that allows you to use either regardless  

**Ivan Herman:** so. we have not made a decision on that  
… but I am happy we have this one the minutes

* [Resolution #2](#resolution2): add `@datatype` for use with value nodes that would be a synonym only in those situations for `@type`
* [Resolution #3](#resolution3): Allow IRIs to be constructed by string concatenation with multiple `@vocabs`, with appropriate security consideration section
* [Resolution #4](#resolution4): Make #56 editorial to add a `"@type":"@vocab"` example and otherwise no change
* [Resolution #5](#resolution5): Add text to Iana Considerations explicitly allowing the request of a context or frame document, plus security consideration on whitelist, plus tests

### 10. Action Items
