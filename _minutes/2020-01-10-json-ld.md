### 2. Announcements / Reminders ?
{: #section2}

**Gregg Kellogg:** I did see something come through from the Go implementation folks  
… they are closing in on full compatibility with 1.1  

**Rob Sanderson:** lovely!  
… and not raising as many issues as the Perl implementation  

**Gregg Kellogg:** often folks use both the tests and the spec to figure it out  
… but sometimes it's nice to have someone be pedantic about the spec on its own  

**Rob Sanderson:** jeff_mixter did you want to mention the Mellon work?  

**Jeff Mixter:** we're working with the library community to build out a sort of central hub of entity descriptions  
… primarily we're focused on works and persons related to works--authors, etc.  
… the relationship with the standards groups will be that we plan to follow all the data publishing guidelines  
… and use JSON-LD 1.1 when we get there  

**Rob Sanderson:** any questions about that?  

**Benjamin Young:** is there a place to track that work?  

**Jeff Mixter:** it was just announced, but I can share that stuff once I have it  

### 3. Issues
{: #section3}

**Jeff Mixter:** and you can reach out to me directly as I'm on the project  

**Rob Sanderson:** there are two that we should discuss in detail  

#### 3.1. Handling @context IRI wording
{: #section3-1}

> *Rob Sanderson:* link: [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-api/issues/265](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-api/issues/265)

**Rob Sanderson:** the reason we've called this one out in particular  
… is that the two Greg(g)'s have different views on what the exact wording should be  

**Gregg Kellogg:** yes. we went back and forth a bit  
… and what Greg was pushing for seemed like a very large rewrite  
… and dlongley chimed it a bit also  
… and that size change didn't seem warranted  
… the core question is how to resolve a relative context URL  
… that text is certainly more vague  
… the base of the document is used to resolve that  
… but that may not be explicitly passed in  
… so dlongley suggested we add a note that we were avoiding being overly prescriptive  
… and a few more notes to clarify the intent and use throughout that section  
… and without changing the API signature  
… given where we are in the publishing process, I don't think a heavier change is warranted  

**Rob Sanderson:** it wouldn't be a normative change would it be?  

**Gregg Kellogg:** it depends on what you believe the boundary of the change is  
… if we're changing API signatures and data that's being passed around  
… then that would be a normative change  

> *Pierre-Antoine Champin:* and that we might introduce new bugs...

**Gregg Kellogg:** there are ways implementations can work around this without our changing the API  

**Rob Sanderson:** any questions/  
… k. I would suggest that we reject this issue on the grounds that we believe this would be a breaking change  
… while it might be clearer to do it the way Greg suggests, the current way works without needing to change API signatures  

**Gregg Kellogg:** no. it actually change the API signature, but the algorithm signature  
… but nonetheless it would have far reaching API ramifications  

**Rob Sanderson:** pchampin what are your thoughts on this one?  

**Pierre-Antoine Champin:** I'm with Greg on this one  
… with gkellogg on this one  
… the potential for new bugs is quite high  

> **Proposed resolution: Reject #265 as overreaching at the current stage of the process; changing algorithm signatures has too far-reaching consequences for a clarity change** *(Rob Sanderson)*
{: .proposed_resolution}

> *Ivan Herman:* +1

> *Gregg Kellogg:* +1

> *Rob Sanderson:* +1

> *Pierre-Antoine Champin:* +1

> *Tim Cole:* +1

> *Benjamin Young:* +1

> *Jeff Mixter:* +1

> ***Resolution #2: Reject #265 as overreaching at the current stage of the process; changing algorithm signatures has too far-reaching consequences for a clarity change***
{: #resolution2 .resolution}

**Gregg Kellogg:** I did mark the issue as rejected  
… but I didn't know if there was more to do to close this up  

**Rob Sanderson:** we should call it out as an issue that was not accepted  
… and point to this resolution as the rational for the rejection  
… we've discussed it, considered it, and rejected the full extent of the change  
… but we plan to add notes to clarify things to avoid future confusion  

**Ivan Herman:** I checked with Ralph about what triggers a full CR or not  
… and it's largely under the control of the WG  
… there's no algorithm for when it should go back to the Director  
… this one does seem to be on the borderline  
… and it would restructure the algorithm heavily  
… and all the other implementers would have to cross check things against the new changes  
… if it's a bug, then it would be justifiable  

**Rob Sanderson:** it's not wrong to implement it the way gkellogg has described it  

**Ivan Herman:** no. of course not  
… no one said they have to follow these algorithm lines specifically  
… they just have to pass the tests  

**Gregg Kellogg:** yes. we say that explicitly actually  

**Ivan Herman:** and if they pass it without following all the algorithm steps, that's fine  

**Rob Sanderson:** any more on this one?  

#### 3.2. Possible bug in Expansion Algorithm step 13.4.16
{: #section3-2}

> *Rob Sanderson:* link: [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-api/issues/270](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-api/issues/270)

**Rob Sanderson:** so the next one is issue 270  
… after some discussion gkellogg believes the test is fixed  
… and added two more tests  
… but since we're changing the tests, we do need to consider this as a group  
… any change to the algorithm that doesn't change the test results is fine  
… but this one changes the test results...so we need to determine the weight of this one  
… it doesn't seem like a dropping us out of CR sort of change  
… gkellogg can you elaborate?  

**Gregg Kellogg:** there was a bug in my implementation based on my misinterpretation of my own text  
… I'll have to dig into it again more closely  
… I'd misinterpreted what his concern was initially  

**Rob Sanderson:** what I recall is that it was a null vs. empty list question  
… and that the test results needed to test for whichever one it should have been rather than the other one  

**Gregg Kellogg:** so the text had previously said if an input type was `@json`  
… because `null` would be kept only in the case for `@value` when the type is `@json`  
… that was a change to the algorithm text  
… in terms of what the test result was...  
… one of these was redundant  
… expand 122 out. it had been an empty string...and should have stayed null  
… so it partly related to that wrong step that shouldn't have been in there  

**Rob Sanderson:** so the good thing is that Greg agrees with these fixes  
… so I think that we should have a resolution  
… that there was essentially a typo in the test result  
… and that we're fixing it by tweaking both the algorithm and the test result  
… and the issue submitter (Greg) agrees with this fix  
… and that we agree this shouldn't trigger a new CR  
… my proposal, then, would be that we suggest a non-normative tweak to the algorithm text and fix what amounts to a typo in the tests  

**Ivan Herman:** so, since as you say the algorithm is non-normative, then we should be fine  
… certainly the algorithm and tests should be in sync  

**Rob Sanderson:** pchampin you're ok with this also?  

**Pierre-Antoine Champin:** yes. it's fine.  

**Rob Sanderson:** so we should note that this would effect other implementation's test results potentially

**Rob Sanderson:** but that we do not believe this requires re-entry into CR

{: #resolution3 .resolution}

> *Ivan Herman:* +1

#### 3.3. Bulk Editorial Changes
{: #section3-3}

**Rob Sanderson:** we have a lot of these...and I don't think we need a resolution for each  

**Ivan Herman:** exactly what I wanted to say  

**Rob Sanderson:** so, if gkellogg and pchampin agree with the changes, then we should probably accept them en masse  

> *Rob Sanderson:* [https://github.com/orgs/w3c/projects/4?fullscreen=true](https://github.com/orgs/w3c/projects/4?fullscreen=true)

**Gregg Kellogg:** most of them are already tagged commenter-agreed  
… one does say it's pending  

> *Rob Sanderson:* In the Editorial Work Complete column

**Gregg Kellogg:** another doesn't have any tags...  
… one is tagged propose-closing  
… and two marked as PR pending  
… and are awaiting feedback from Greg  

**Rob Sanderson:** so, if you use this project link [https://github.com/orgs/w3c/projects/4?fullscreen=true](https://github.com/orgs/w3c/projects/4?fullscreen=true)  
… you can click through to each issue  
… there seems to be general agreement throughout  

**Gregg Kellogg:** some of these are straightforward...like things that fell off during a merge  
… some do involve some haggling over words  

**Rob Sanderson:** and at least one of these points to a test that should've probably been implemented  
… 277 was about `@language`  
… 278 was moving some text around assertions rather than errors  
… 279 seems related to the earlier one about concatenation  
… 289 a variable was reused  

**Gregg Kellogg:** right, they needed to be made distinct  

**Rob Sanderson:** 282...  

**Gregg Kellogg:** that one needed a test as well  
… the way the test was written it ignored something as an invalid triple  
… but on a closer reading of the text, it should've thrown an error  
… so this needs an expansion test  

**Rob Sanderson:** so this one probably needs a separate resolution  
… so my understanding of this issue is that the test used to be that for wellformedness...  
… it should now track that a datatype with an IRI of null would throw an error  

**Gregg Kellogg:** yeah. I was confusing these...it was a bit of an omnibus issue  
… so I'm not sure this one had any test changes  

**Rob Sanderson:** ah. it would still result in it not being valid...it just would've been caught earlier, correct?  

**Gregg Kellogg:** right  

**Rob Sanderson:** so if no tests change, we can keep going down the list  
… 292...the expansion of null in `@value`...so it's similar to the previous one  

**Gregg Kellogg:** there was an earlier issue where words in the expansion algorithm moved  
… and they run every time now vs. just at the end  
… and that seems to have generated lots of these  
… however, we did move that part back to the end  
… but there were other changes to make sure all the content was part of an algorithmic step  

**Rob Sanderson:** so, let's keep digging for ones that may have normative changes...  

**Gregg Kellogg:** so in 303, there was a previously correct result which is now flagged as an error  

**Rob Sanderson:** I don't think we need a resolution for that  
… because no other system would do anything different  

> *Rob Sanderson:* [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-framing/issues/88](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-framing/issues/88)

**Rob Sanderson:** so, here's a framing issue  

**Gregg Kellogg:** this is about the omitGraph flag  
… it takes a boolean of course  
… it was the default for 1.0  
… so to get the correct 1.1 behavior, you now need to set omitGraph to false  
… there was also the example that hadn't been adequately updated  
… Greg did agree with the changes in the end  
… it is just a change to the example text at this point  

**Ivan Herman:** so, for the future  
… if there's an editorial-based change, and the commenter agrees with those changes, then we could agree that in those cases gkellogg can close them  

**Gregg Kellogg:** maybe we need a proposal that issues that do not result in a change to test behavior to which the commenter agrees can be merged without further discussion  

**Ivan Herman:** yes. maybe such a list won't happen again  

**Gregg Kellogg:** well...Greg plans to do compaction  

**Ivan Herman:** that's fine, but I do think we should resolve to implement such a process  

**Rob Sanderson:** so let's do one proposal to cover all these issues we just rattled through

{: #resolution6 .resolution}

**Ivan Herman:** I won't be generating the minutes this weekend, but we should be OK to go ahead with this resolution without them  

**Rob Sanderson:** are there any other issues that need discussion?  

**Gregg Kellogg:** there are a few others I think we can close quickly  

**Ivan Herman:** the ones you mentions are indeed done  

**Rob Sanderson:** and without a resolution, correct?  
… they're done...or we wouldn't be in CR  
… so yes, we'll close them  
… with 5 minutes...there's probably not time to talk about Best Practices  

**Ivan Herman:** I'm curious about a few other things also, like the CBOR note  
… and whether we think we'll see a C or C++ implementation  

**Gregg Kellogg:** per Manu, I think there is a C or C++ implementation in progress  

**Ivan Herman:** so we'll have C/C++, Go, Ruby, JavaScript  

**Rob Sanderson:** also Perl  

**Ivan Herman:** and pchampin how's Rust?  

**Pierre-Antoine Champin:** sadly, I won't be able to do that on my own  
… but someone has commented on the list in November  
… and I might try and help them, but I won't be able to lead them  

**Ivan Herman:** as I see it now, we're in good shape to publish the specs before the end of our charter  
… in parallel this whole Process 2020 will come out in the coming months  
… so it may be a good conversation to have soon about what we do next  
… so, for instance, the Verifiable Claims WG has been rechartered  
… that sort of thing didn't used to happen  
… but now there's a maintenance mode for groups  
… and maybe we could consider that  
… we have some other items we haven't gotten too  
… we don't have to discuss it now, but soon  

**Rob Sanderson:** agreed  
… I'd be very surprised if there's ever such a huge number of small issues like these again  
… and Greg's Perl implementation is down to less than 10 tests that don't pass  

**Ivan Herman:** do we know the state of the JS implementation?  

**Gregg Kellogg:** I've been working on that, actually  
… there are issues with the HTML tests  
… because the XML DOM parsing library in use now eats the entity escapes  
… and we have tests to make sure that doesn't happen  
… so those fail  
… but I'm narrowing in on completion  
… hopefully within the next month  

**Ivan Herman:** sounds good  

**Rob Sanderson:** and Python?  

**Gregg Kellogg:** I've not begun on that yet, but that's meant to be next, yes.
