{: #resolution1 .resolution}

### 2. Announcements?
{: #section2}


**Rob Sanderson:** We have the open call for consensus to go for CR.  

### 3. Issues
{: #section3}

#### 3.1. embedding issue #300
{: #section3-1}

> *Rob Sanderson:* [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/300](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/300)

**Rob Sanderson:** All new issues are editorial, which is good for our transition to CR.  
… The first one was about some confusion about how embedding worked.  
… It was clarified in the issue, and there is a PR open to fix it.  

**Pierre-Antoine Champin:** Gregg and I both submitted a separate PR to fix this problem.  
… But now we merged both of them. So this issue should be closed once the PR is merged.  

> *Benjamin Young:* [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/300](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/300)

> *Benjamin Young:* [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/pull/307](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/pull/307)

**Pierre-Antoine Champin:** The current sentence is wrong. The actual reason why embedding does not work is that nodes are unrelated to each other. So this is a reason to have `@graph` at the top level.  
… I'll make a change suggestion on the PR. After that, we can close the issue if everyone agrees.  

**Rob Sanderson:** Part of the fix has been merged to master already, part of it not yet.  
… Any further questions about issue 300?  

**Pierre-Antoine Champin:** PR 307 can be closed because the fix was part of another PR.  

**Rob Sanderson:** So issue 300 can be closed then.  

#### 3.2. Stars on type on example 13
{: #section3-2}

**Rob Sanderson:** Next one is about the stars. This has been solved and is closed.  

> *Rob Sanderson:* [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/303](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/303)

#### 3.3. Clarify language in JsonLdProcessor API
{: #section3-3}

**Rob Sanderson:** Next, two issues on API.  

> *Rob Sanderson:* [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-api/issues/212](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-api/issues/212)

**Rob Sanderson:** First one is about the use of WebIDL and the JavaScript-specific language that WebIDL has.  

> *Rob Sanderson:* [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-api/issues/212#issuecomment-556476697](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-api/issues/212#issuecomment-556476697)

**Rob Sanderson:** The language talks about JS-specific promises to talk about asynchronous operations, while other languages may not have promises.  
… Gregg already clarified that we settled with WebIDL, but we don't require promises, it's just a way to get it into WebIDL. Gregg suggested to add a note saying that you don't have to implement promises to do async operations.  
… The way forward on this one is clear.  

#### 3.4. Expansion with blank node mapped prefixes
{: #section3-4}

> *Rob Sanderson:* [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-api/issues/219](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-api/issues/219)

**Rob Sanderson:** On this next issue, the author started from scratch. So he saw something that does not usually occur in brand new implementations.  
… If you have a blank node prefix without a non-gen-delim char at the end, it is expected to be used as a prefix in the tests, but the spec does not describe this strictly.  
… We can't remove features, so we have to allow this.  

> *Pierre-Antoine Champin:* [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-api/issues/205](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-api/issues/205)

**Pierre-Antoine Champin:** This seems related to a previous issue where this was discussed.  
… Gregg came into a similar problem where a bnode was used as a prefix.  
… I thought we settled on this, and marking those tests that rely on bnodes as prefixes as 1.0-only.  
… In practice this is a breaking change in 1.1.  
… At the time we agreed that anyone in their right mind would do this. So this wasn't a problem.  
… I guess that the solution to this issue would be to mark this as a 1.0-only test as well.  
… Not sure why Gregg didn't suggest this, perhaps he overlooked the link to the previous discussion.  
… I will add it to the issue.  

**Rob Sanderson:** Those were the raised issues.  

### 4. Document Process Issues
{: #section4}

#### 4.1. Transition to CR
{: #section4-1}

**Rob Sanderson:** We agreed on the last call that we would leave the call for consensus open until Monday.  
… Today, we can have a resolution to go for CR if no one else puts in a -1 on the mailinglist before Monday.  
… This allows Ivan to send it to the director then to request the transition.

{: #resolution2 .resolution}

#### 4.2. Java implementation
{: #section4-2}

> *Rob Sanderson:* [https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-json-ld-wg/2019Nov/0024.html](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-json-ld-wg/2019Nov/0024.html)

**Rob Sanderson:** There was an e-mail to the list about the Java impl from David Booth, which prompted a little thread.  
… There is a Java 1.1 impl that has 1/3 failing tests, which is good.  
… They have similar reasons, so they may start working at the same time soon.  
… Someone will start updating early next week.  
… We always said we needed the Java impl as code.  

**Harold Solbrig:** We started to prototype the use of 1.1 in healthcare, and it's been successful, and the Java impl will be important for this.  

**Benjamin Young:** Next phase of this is that fabulous like this start happening, so we have to write things like blog posts to increase visibility.  

#### 4.3. Best Practices Doc
{: #section4-3}

**Harold Solbrig:** We're going to need a more approachable document, like a primer.  

**Rob Sanderson:** Where are we with BP?  

> *Benjamin Young:* [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-bp/pull/17](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-bp/pull/17)

**Benjamin Young:** This PR restructures everything to make suggestions.  

> *Rob Sanderson:* [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-bp/issues/1](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-bp/issues/1)

**Rob Sanderson:** This PR would close issue 1.  

> *Adam Soroka:* [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-bp/issues/15](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-bp/issues/15)

**Benjamin Young:** Several new sections, and API-related sections from 1.0.  

> *Rob Sanderson:* +1 to removing non-spec practices

**Benjamin Young:** My plan is to take the API-related things out, and capture the things that have come across in the last months.  
… Any help on this is welcome.  

> *Benjamin Young:* [https://w3c.github.io/json-ld-bp/](https://w3c.github.io/json-ld-bp/)

**Benjamin Young:** How should we look at the current document state.  
… It is github-pages-based.  

**Rob Sanderson:** We should now look through what there is now. And propose new sections through issues, with some ticks on what the issue is.  

**Benjamin Young:** If you don't have time, just write it down in an issue, and then we can figure out where to put it later.  

**Rob Sanderson:** We have some time left, so let's brainstorm on some issues.  

**Pierre-Antoine Champin:** I just realized that Gregg mentioned in his regrets something.  
… He said that there may be a WG decision needed.  

### 5. API #219 redux
{: #section5}

**Pierre-Antoine Champin:** he would be more comfortable to keep the spec text as-is, and that we are introducing a breaking change in a note.  
… He wants to record this as a decision.  

> *Benjamin Young:* gkellog's note about #219 [https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-json-ld-wg/2019Nov/0033.html](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-json-ld-wg/2019Nov/0033.html)

**Rob Sanderson:** We're stuck with it, especially as we plan to go for CR.  

**Pierre-Antoine Champin:** He wants to keep the spec as-is, but mark the tests as 1.0-only, and continue on the same path.  
… Nobody is affected by this change.  

**Benjamin Young:** It was an accidental feature in 1.0.  

**Rob Sanderson:** So it is not a breaking change, but a clarification that this should never have been possible.  

**Benjamin Young:** It would be good to see where this can actually be used. And if it has widely been used in practise. Probably no one did.  

**Pierre-Antoine Champin:** If we want to support it now, we would have to change some normative text right before CR.  

**Benjamin Young:** This won't happen.  

> **Proposed resolution: Keep the current text as clarification that blank node as prefix was never intended to be a feature, just a side effect of loose 1.0 text** *(Rob Sanderson)*
{: .proposed_resolution}

**Rob Sanderson:** If there was a test, it was supposed to be a feature, right?  

> *Benjamin Young:* [https://json-ld.org/playground/#startTab=tab-expanded&json-ld=%7B%22%40context%22%3A%7B%22%40vocab%22%3A%22_%3A%22%2C%22term%22%3A%22term%22%7D%2C%22term%22%3A%22hi%22%7D](https://json-ld.org/playground/#startTab=tab-expanded&json-ld=%7B%22%40context%22%3A%7B%22%40vocab%22%3A%22_%3A%22%2C%22term%22%3A%22term%22%7D%2C%22term%22%3A%22hi%22%7D)

> *Benjamin Young:* `{"@context": {"@vocab": "_:", "term": "term"}, "term": "hi"}`

**Benjamin Young:** This case will occur when someone when someone without much knowledge of jsonld will use it.  

**Pierre-Antoine Champin:** The alternative would be to go for Gregg's proposal, to add a sentence to explicitly allow that.

> *Rob Sanderson:*
```json
{
"@context": {
  "@vocab": "_:",
  "term": "term",
  "pre": "_:pre",
  "fix": "pre:fix"
 },
"term": "hi",
```

**Pierre-Antoine Champin:** This is normative text. That's meaning that's already carried by the tests.  

> *Rob Sanderson:* "fix": "me please"

> *Rob Sanderson:* }

> *Rob Sanderson:* -->

> *Benjamin Young:* the extension use case `{"@context": [{"@vocab": "_:"}, {"term": "term"}], "term": "hi"}`

> *Rob Sanderson:* 
```json
"_:prefix": [
{
  "@value": "me please"
}
],
```

**Rob Sanderson:** The prefix thing is what's currently broken.  
… Currently, this case above works in 1.0, but not in 1.1 when you implement it from scratch.  
… If people don't remove it from their 1.1 impls, we would have inconsistencies.  
… I think we should fix the typo which removes this feature unintentionally. Even if it is a stupid feature.  

> *Pierre-Antoine Champin:* [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-api/blob/master/tests/expand/0118-in.jsonld#L31](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-api/blob/master/tests/expand/0118-in.jsonld#L31)

**Pierre-Antoine Champin:** The previous issue was raised by Gregg. The mention the test (above).  
… (wrong test)  

> *Benjamin Young:* an updated extension example (based on azaroth's) `{"@context": [{"@vocab": "_:"}, {"pre": "pre", "fix": "pre:fix"}], "pre": "hi", "fix": "thing"}`

> *Rob Sanderson:* [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-api/blob/master/tests/toRdf/0118-in.jsonld](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-api/blob/master/tests/toRdf/0118-in.jsonld)

**Rob Sanderson:** This is the test that checks term appended to bnode.  
… I think that if someone would come to us an say that this test was supposed to be 1.0, but there was no resolution saying that this was a 1.0-only feature, and no errata. I would have a hard time explaining why this feature was removed from 1.0, even though it is stupid.  
… We want to avoid changing the API spec.  

**Benjamin Young:** I'm confused to see how it was an accident while it has tests.  

**Rob Sanderson:** I becomes harder to implement, and it is a case that no one will use.  
… We said we wouldn't introduce incompatibilities.  
… We should say we are fixing a typo, which removes an unintentional feature.  

**Pierre-Antoine Champin:** I think gregg and dave's concern about explicitly allowing that, would make the spec text more complicated.  
… In 1.0, nothing was required to allow it. While our 1.1 text would need to explicitly state that it is not allowed.  
… I also think we should fix the typo.  

**Benjamin Young:** Does it make sense to use the at-risk process, and have the implementors in the room, and remove at-risk if all implementors agree?  

**Rob Sanderson:** In the 1.0 spec, there wasn't any text saying that you should be able to do this?  

**Pierre-Antoine Champin:** I will look into it.  

**Rob Sanderson:** If the normative 1.0 spec didn't say that you can do this, we can remove it, as the tests are not normative.  
… But we need to be sure that the spec did not say it.  
… We can try the at-risk "trick".  

**Tim Cole:** If there was a test for 1.0, do we have a case where an implementor supported this?  

**Rob Sanderson:** Tests got run to prove implementations.  

**Benjamin Young:** It's working now in the playground.  

> *David I. Lehn:* pyld passed all 1.0 tests at one point too

> *Rob Sanderson:* [https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/json-ld/raw-file/default/test-suite/reports/cr-20131022.html#transform-json-ld-to-rdf](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/json-ld/raw-file/default/test-suite/reports/cr-20131022.html#transform-json-ld-to-rdf)

**Rob Sanderson:** There are 9 implementations passing the test.  
… That's hard to argue against.  

> *Tim Cole:* +1

**Rob Sanderson:** We should not put at-risk, and fix the unintentional removal of the feature.

> *Benjamin Young:* "Triples with blank node predicates are not dropped if the produce generalized RDF flag is true."

**Benjamin Young:** The issue that I posted seems to indicate that there was a purpose for this.
