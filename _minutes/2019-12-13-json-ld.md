### 3. Announcements
{: #section3}

**Rob Sanderson:** CR was published!  

> *Rob Sanderson:* [https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/)

> *Gregg Kellogg:* [https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/) now points to 1.1 CR

**Rob Sanderson:** thanks to everyone invoved in the process.  

**Gregg Kellogg:** TR/json-ld/ also now points to the CR  

> *Gregg Kellogg:* [https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld1/](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld1/)

**Gregg Kellogg:** TR/json-ld1/ points to the 1.0 REC  
… I would have expected TR/json-ld10/, but it does not work  

**David I. Lehn:** we should be careful what json-ld.org points to as "recommendations"  
… also TR/json-ld-api/ returns a 404  

**Ivan Herman:** I sent a mail to emphasize how we should process changes now.  
… editorial changes are ok, as long as we give the correct flag to echidna.  
… gkellogg, you should take care of that, I am not comfortable with changing your configuration.  

> *Gregg Kellogg:* - curl "https://labs.w3.org/echidna/api/request" --data "url=$URL" --data "decision=$DECISION" --data "token=$TOKEN"

> *Ivan Herman:* See [CR publication with Echidna](https://github.com/w3c/echidna/wiki/CR-publication-workflow)

**Ivan Herman:** if we have more substantial changes, we must again submit to the director  
… and such changes must be thoroughly documented  

**Gregg Kellogg:** every PR for an issue must refer to a resolution (by email or on a call)  

**Ivan Herman:** we had some discussion offline about writing a blog post;  
… I think that this should be done by the chairs  

**Gregg Kellogg:** I have a text ready, I can put it on my blog  

**Benjamin Young:** I am also happy with publishing gkellogg's text  

> ***Action #1: make google doc to co-edit, to be posted next week (Benjamin Young)***
{: #action1 .action}

**Rob Sanderson:** let's copy gkellogg's text in a google doc and work on it,  
… and get it published by monday  

### 4. Issues
{: #section4}

#### 4.1. XHTML vs HTML
{: #section4-1}

> *Rob Sanderson:* [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-api/issues/244](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-api/issues/244)

**Rob Sanderson:** gkellogg objected that XHTML is not an active spec  
… but the author or the issue noted that application/xhtml+xml is one of the content-types specified for HTML 5.2  

**Ivan Herman:** my initial reaction was the same as gkellogg, but the latest argument is compelling  

> *Rob Sanderson:* [https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11-api/#dfn-html-script-extraction](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11-api/#dfn-html-script-extraction)

**Ivan Herman:** but since both content-types are for the same format,  
… all we have to do is add "or 'application/xhtml+xml'" whenever we mention 'text/html'  
… Also, epub still refers to XHTML.  

**Gregg Kellogg:** my concern was that XHTML 1.0 would use different encoding for scripts.  
… If this is just about accepting 'application/xhtml+xml' for HTML5, this is not a problem.  
… I would rather not wait on this thing. It is easy to get lost.  

**Ivan Herman:** if we want to republish something between now and end of CR,  
… this is borderline to substantial change.  

**Gregg Kellogg:** we will have the same problems with other issues.  

**Ivan Herman:** many things that will come up are hopefully editorial.  

**Rob Sanderson:** given the other issues, we will probably want to update the CR.  
… considering this is day 1, and we already have a list of issues and associated PRs.  

**Ivan Herman:** we are not talking about going back to WD.  
… but we need to go to the director again if we make non-substantial changes.  

**Gregg Kellogg:** last week we resolved that changes in the text of the algorithms  
… that does not change the result of any test suite,  

> *Gregg Kellogg:* [https://www.w3.org/2018/json-ld-wg/Meetings/Minutes/2019/2019-12-06-json-ld#resolution3](https://www.w3.org/2018/json-ld-wg/Meetings/Minutes/2019/2019-12-06-json-ld#resolution3)

**Gregg Kellogg:** would be considered editorial.  

**Rob Sanderson:** but surely we were referring the existing test suite  

**Gregg Kellogg:** dlehn proposed to add new tests, to address some corner cases  
… I thing resolution3 is about "not changing the result of any existing test"  

> **Proposed resolution: We accept that syntax and api should also refer to XHTML where they refer to text/html** *(Rob Sanderson)*

> ***Resolution #2: We accept that syntax and api should also refer to XHTML where they refer to text/html***
{: #resolution2 .resolution}

#### 4.2. JSON-LD featuring JSON featuring JSON-LD test
{: #section4-2}

> *Rob Sanderson:* [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-api/issues/237](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-api/issues/237)

**David I. Lehn:** a literal JSON can contain JSON-LD (e.g. a `@context` key)  
… we need to make sure that processors do *not* try to process that  

**Rob Sanderson:** this is only editorial; the text already says "do not touch this"  

> **Proposed resolution: Accept test for JSON-LD embedded in JSON to test suite (no editorial action)** *(Rob Sanderson)*
{: .proposed_resolution}

> *Rob Sanderson:* +1

**David I. Lehn:** how should we process such issues?  

> *Ivan Herman:* +1

> *Tim Cole:* +1

**Ivan Herman:** I don't think we should use meeting time for this  

> *Harold Solbrig:* +1

> *David I. Lehn:* +1

> *Pierre-Antoine Champin:* +1

> ***Resolution #3: Accept test for JSON-LD embedded in JSON to test suite (no editorial action)***
{: #resolution3 .resolution}

> *Gregg Kellogg:* +1

**Rob Sanderson:** but we need to point to a resolution in the PR solving the issue  

#### 4.3. Return of the adding an entry step
{: #section4-3}

> *Rob Sanderson:* [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-api/issues/243](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-api/issues/243)

> *Rob Sanderson:* [https://w3c.github.io/json-ld-api/#expansion-algorithm](https://w3c.github.io/json-ld-api/#expansion-algorithm)

**Rob Sanderson:** in the expansion algorithm, step 13.4.4.4 and 13.4.4.5  
… there is the same text repeated  
… looks like a copy-paste error  

> **Proposed resolution: remove repeated text from expansion 13.4.4.4** *(Rob Sanderson)*
{: .proposed_resolution}

> *Gregg Kellogg:* +1

> *Harold Solbrig:* +1

> *Rob Sanderson:* +1

> *Benjamin Young:* +1

> ***Resolution #4: remove repeated text from expansion 13.4.4.4***
{: #resolution4 .resolution}

#### 4.4. `@graph`, `@set`
{: #section4-4}

> *Rob Sanderson:* [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-api/issues/242](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-api/issues/242)

**Rob Sanderson:** `"@container": ["@graph", "@set"]` is used in a test, but the text of the algorithm implies that it is illegal  

**Gregg Kellogg:** this is an ommision in the algorithm in the list of things allowed with `@graph`  
… the normative section of the syntax does allow this combination  

> *Gregg Kellogg:* [http://localhost:8000/?specStatus=CR&publishDate=2019-12-12#expanded-term-definition](http://localhost:8000/?specStatus=CR&publishDate=2019-12-12#expanded-term-definition)

> *Pierre-Antoine Champin:* [https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/#expanded-term-definition](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/#expanded-term-definition)

> *Rob Sanderson:* > If the expanded term definition contains the @container keyword, its value MUST be either `@list`, `@set`, `@language`, `@index`, `@id`, `@graph`, `@type`, or be null or an array containing exactly any one of those keywords, or a combination of `@set` and any of `@index`, `@id`, `@graph`, `@type`, `@language` in any order

**Rob Sanderson:** so the API and Syntax documents are out of sync  

**Gregg Kellogg:** there was examples specifically added about it  

> **Proposed resolution: Update api Create Term Definition step to allow the set of combinations from syntax 9.15.1** *(Rob Sanderson)*

#### 4.5. Create Term Definition 16.1 needs more indents
{: #section4-5}

> *Rob Sanderson:* [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-api/issues/241](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-api/issues/241)

**Gregg Kellogg:** we added some text in 16.1 to retain the information that `@id` has value `null`  

> **Proposed resolution: Add to 16.1 that the following substeps should be skipped** *(Rob Sanderson)*
{: .proposed_resolution}

**Gregg Kellogg:** in my code, the following substeps are skipped  

> **Proposed resolution: Add to 16.1 that the following substeps should be skipped if the test for null is true** *(Rob Sanderson)*

{: #resolution6 .resolution}

#### 4.6. Create Term Definition 16.5 should set defined?
{: #section4-6}

> *Rob Sanderson:* [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-api/issues/245](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-api/issues/245)

**Gregg Kellogg:** when a term has the form of a CURIE, it is possible that the prefix has not yet been defined  
… so we recursively call "expand IRI";  
… we keep track of defined terms, this should be updated accordingly  
… also, we should have that it should be resolved against the vocabulary  

> **Proposed resolution: Add to Create Term Definition 16.5 that defined should be set to True, and that it should be resolved as vocabulary relative by adding the appropriate parameter** *(Rob Sanderson)*

{: #resolution7 .resolution}

#### 4.7. Type-scoped context propagation
{: #section4-7}

> *Rob Sanderson:* [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-api/issues/246](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-api/issues/246)

**Gregg Kellogg:** when a typed-scoped context is encountered,  
… define context is called; the parameters passed to it are wrong  
… the 'propagate' parameter should be 'false', but the default value 'true' is currently used  
… The good news is that we do have tests for this corner case.  
… The intention is clear.  

> **Proposed resolution: Add to Expansion 11.2 that it should pass false for the propagate option for type-scoped contexts** *(Rob Sanderson)*

### 5. Recursive contexts (hsolbrig)
{: #section5}

**Harold Solbrig:** we discovered that in our use cases, we have a lot of recursive contexts.  
… And I though I read that those were not allowed,  
… but couldn't find it in the syntax document.  
… So if context A references context B, and context B references A, what should happen?  

**Gregg Kellogg:** step 5.2.3 explictly says that a context previously dereferenced should not be dereferenced again.  

> *Rob Sanderson:* Previous resolution - [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-api/issues/14](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-api/issues/14)

**Harold Solbrig:** the playground complained about it last week. So that's a bug in the playground?  

**Gregg Kellogg:** yes  

**David I. Lehn:** about the playground, we just updated it to a new version,  
… changin how contexts are loaded.  
… That's probably why you saw a change.  
… The new version passes all the tests.  
… May be some new test is needed here?  

**Harold Solbrig:** we had a very simple example, with a context referencing itself.  

**Gregg Kellogg:** I'll check if we don't already have a test for that.  

**David I. Lehn:** can we sum up which URLs should be pointed to in json-ld.org?  

**Ivan Herman:** starting from CR, the "latest" URL points to CR  

**Gregg Kellogg:** I don't think we should point anyone to 1.0 now  

**David I. Lehn:** [https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld-api/](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld-api/) currently returns a 404  

**Gregg Kellogg:** it probably tries to redirect to [https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld-api11/,](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld-api11/,) but we named it [https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11-api/](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11-api/)  

**David I. Lehn:** what about TR/json-ld-syntax?  

**Gregg Kellogg:** it should not exist...  

> *Ivan Herman:* [https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/) [https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld-api/](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld-api/) [https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld-framing/](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld-framing/)

**Gregg Kellogg:** but if it has always been here, we should not mess with it  

> *Gregg Kellogg:* [https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld-syntax/](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld-syntax/)

**Ivan Herman:** the three URLs above should work, right?  
… the middle one does not work, which is a bug  

> *Gregg Kellogg:* [https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld-api1/](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld-api1/)

**Gregg Kellogg:** the link above should not exist either  

> *Gregg Kellogg:* [https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld1-api/](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld1-api/)

**Ivan Herman:** I'll contact the webmaster right now
