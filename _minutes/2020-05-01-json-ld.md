### 1. Transition
{: #section1}

> *Rob Sanderson:* [https://github.com/w3c/transitions/issues/239#issuecomment-622366899](https://github.com/w3c/transitions/issues/239#issuecomment-622366899)

**Rob Sanderson:** Ralph approved the core specs after gkellogg and I responded to his questions about `@prefix`  
… there's the link to the approval  
… and in that thread there's also mention of Process 2020  
… there are new charters that are in draft that mention it  
… but we need to time ours correctly  

**Ivan Herman:** yes. for the time being we don't have to change anything  

**Rob Sanderson:** the important thing is that we've said we want to  
… but told we can't yet  
… but once it's ready, so are we  

**Ivan Herman:** I've asked the web master and the communications team to help promote the transitions  
… so, May 7th, if that's good for us  
… I'd need to have all the documents done  
… meaning, the three rec track docs + the streaming note  
… then I would start the whole process  
… and then send out the publication request  

**Gregg Kellogg:** isn't there some wording changes to the specs about our future group?  

**Ivan Herman:** no, there's nothing in the specs  
… just have the specs marked as finalized on May 7th  

**Gregg Kellogg:** right. frozen snap shots in the right directories  
… there was some confusion in respec about what the appropriate status is for the note  
… fpwd or fpwg  
… it's currently fpwd  
… and there's some other error showing in the checker about some missing section which is visibly there  
… I noted it in the issue  

**Ivan Herman:** yeah. that one's a minor thing  
… I can connect with them about it  
… so if everything else goes to plan, then next Thursday these go up  
… not sure about the formal charter proposal going out  
… probably a week later--which is fine  
… and that should be all we have to do now  

> ***Action #1: create publication snapshots for 3 specs and streaming note. (Gregg Kellogg)***
{: #action1 .action}

**Ivan Herman:** gkellogg knows this, but from that point on the document is frozen  
… other than obvious spelling mistakes and such  
… the reports and tests can be living things--it's ok to touch them  
… but not the documents themselves  
… maybe we also talk about errata today?  

**Rob Sanderson:** gkellogg for the streaming note, did you want to talk about the respec stuff?  

**Gregg Kellogg:** yeah, that's the fpwd thing...which is probably causing the other issue  

**Rob Sanderson:** ah. that's the streaming note?  

**Gregg Kellogg:** yep

**Rob Sanderson:** do we need to confirm the date with a vote?

> ***Resolution #1: Publish 3 rec track documents to PR and streaming note to TR on May 7th***
{: #resolution1 .resolution}

**Gregg Kellogg:** it would be nice to see if we could aggregate all the actions together across all the minutes  

**Benjamin Young:** we could express the actions there, and then scrap them  

**Gregg Kellogg:** manu's got a script that does that  

**Ivan Herman:** we're also talking about getting rid of IRC  

**Gregg Kellogg:** that would be a shame  

**Ivan Herman:** yeah, but some companies are blocking ports to they're using the web client  
… and that's pretty antique  

### 2. Errata Management
{: #section2}

**Rob Sanderson:** so...onward :)  
… thanks to dlehn for bringing up the CSS issue  

**Ivan Herman:** which I've fixed while everyone was sleeping  

**Rob Sanderson:** anything else left for the errata management stuff?  

> *Rob Sanderson:* [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-api/pull/483](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-api/pull/483)

**Ivan Herman:** whenever I made a PR to the API repo, I get all kinds of funny warnings from my git client here  
… the commit went through, but I've no idea what those are about  
… so gkellogg I may need your help  
… or that gkellogg at least do the merge  
… so, please push the button gkellogg and I'll follow it up if necessary  
… do we also want errata for the notes?  

**Gregg Kellogg:** do they get frozen  

**Ivan Herman:** no  

**Gregg Kellogg:** then let's not  
… because errata are pretty much out-of-band, and folks have to go read them and know they're there  
… are they linked from the spec?  

**Ivan Herman:** not yet, but when we go to Rec they should  
… we can go ahead and put a link in via Respec  

**Gregg Kellogg:** so it should do it automatically  
… and nothing to do but add the header entry  

**Ivan Herman:** to put people's minds at ease we are considering Matrix  

### 3. Base Context Discussion
{: #section3}

**Rob Sanderson:** should we talk about the base context if there's no other items?  

> *Benjamin Young:* [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-rc/pull/8](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-rc/pull/8)

**Ivan Herman:** can we try to focus on the 4 categories?  
… so we can talk through what we should or should not do around those?  

> *Rob Sanderson:* [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-rc/pull/8#issuecomment-618297517](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-rc/pull/8#issuecomment-618297517)

**Ivan Herman:** can we take those one by one?  

> **Proposed resolution: the set of prefixes are dc11, dcterms, dctype, rdf, rdfs, schema, and xsd, with schema mapping on http.** *(Rob Sanderson)*
{: .proposed_resolution}

> *Rob Sanderson:* +1

> *Gregg Kellogg:* +1

> *Ivan Herman:* +1

**Harold Solbrig:** what does "schema mapping on http" mean?  

**Rob Sanderson:** it means not "https://"  
… but the schema.org community uses [http://](http://) so we should to  
… otherwise we differ from them...though they do say others can  

**Gregg Kellogg:** yeah. they essentially have their own processing that differs from RDF's  

**Harold Solbrig:** are the aliases and prefixes in the same context?  
… was SKOS discussed?  

> *Harold Solbrig:* +1

> ***Resolution #2: the set of prefixes are dc11, dcterms, dctype, rdf, rdfs, schema, and xsd, with schema mapping on http***
{: #resolution2 .resolution}

**Ivan Herman:** it's not that widely used, so we limited the list  

**Harold Solbrig:** SKOS is widely used  

**Rob Sanderson:** we use it  

**Benjamin Young:** so does Wiley  

> **Proposed resolution: the set of aliases are direction, graph, id, included, json, language, none, and type.** *(Rob Sanderson)*
{: .proposed_resolution}

> *Rob Sanderson:* +1

**Rob Sanderson:** but, whatever, we took it out  

> *Benjamin Young:* -1

**Gregg Kellogg:** I'm sympathetic with bigbluehat's concerns about the aliases  
… we did use `@` on purpose  
… and not using it does conflict with existing JSON  
… and it doesn't make JSON-LD obvious along side other JSON  
… I'm not a +1 or -1...probably a +/-0  

**Rob Sanderson:** we agree about the prefixes  
… the prefixes, terms, and datatypes we're all ok with, correct?  

**Gregg Kellogg:** I don't think there's any place we use "json" as a data type in JSON-LD  
… so we're just left with "html"  
… and is it really worth creating a separate data type for that?  
… and if so, why not add XML?  

**Rob Sanderson:** so, I think we're all OK removing data types  

> **Proposed resolution: Remove the datatypes HTML and JSON from the context** *(Rob Sanderson)*
{: .proposed_resolution}

> *Rob Sanderson:* +1

> *Ivan Herman:* +1

> *Gregg Kellogg:* +1

> *Harold Solbrig:* +1

**Harold Solbrig:** can I pick and choose these? or is this a single file?  

> *Benjamin Young:* +1

> ***Resolution #3: Remove the datatypes HTML and JSON from the context***
{: #resolution3 .resolution}

**Rob Sanderson:** we agree about 1 and 3, but disagree on 2 and 4  
… one suggestion was to pull aliases into a separate context file  
… so, aliases.context and prefix.context and aggregate.context which covers both  

> *Rob Sanderson:* top-context includes prefix-context, alias-context

**Gregg Kellogg:** but then just define your own context  

**Harold Solbrig:** except when it comes to prefixes, if we don't come up with a handy collect--even paired down as much as this one is  
… then each community is going to come up with their own  
… and I think as far as best practices go, pulling the prefixes out more clearly in the JSON-LD context file definitions themselves would be helpful  
… and most of these aliases conflict with existing terms, so we wouldn't use this as is  

**Ivan Herman:** I'm fine if we do a context file for prefixes  
… and another for aliases--some people like them; I don't, but whatever  
… I would not do a third one, though  
… we haven't yet talked about comment, label, etc.  
… but separate the aliases  
… having the common terms--maybe less than what's there--and the prefixes should be fine  

**Benjamin Young:** Where we're headed now is good to take out the top level context. Most of my concerns is taking the top level, and will run afoul of communities  
… that they should pick these, and there's conflicts with other widely used ones, such as language in schema.org  
… in dedicated communities, make all the aliases you want, and if there are shared patterns, then share them in the community  
… but if we do it, then we're defining them for /everyone/  
… thus a few prefixes, and maybe a few terms  
… would prefer a longer list of prefixes -- the w3c specs and surrounding communities  

> *Rob Sanderson:* 1+

**Rob Sanderson:** to answer ivan about pre-defined terms  
… there's an issue, not about the mapping, but around the value space of the JSON  
… so there's a question about `label` and how we map it to a string or a language map  
… so when we put label into the predefined terms we've made a decision  
… and in IIIF we've moved from a string from a language map  
… but conversely in Linked Art, we've used rdfs:label as a string for developers for non-I18N labels  
… and use something else for lang string stuff  
… so that's the danger for the terms because they make determinations about the value space  

**Ivan Herman:** I get that, so simply taking out the value space would fix that, no?  

**Rob Sanderson:** sadly not, you'd still have to redefine it  
… it would default to being a literal, I guess  

> *Rob Sanderson:* > "label": "rdfs:label"

**Rob Sanderson:** but you'd have to still define it if you wanted it to be a language map  
… "label": "rdfs:label" would be an xsd:string  

> *Rob Sanderson:* "label": {"en": "english label"}

**Ivan Herman:** no, it defaults to nothing  

**Rob Sanderson:** well, if you put a language map in there, it wouldn't be treated as a language map  

**Gregg Kellogg:** if we did make it a language map, you can still use string values  
… if you used a string, then it'd be xsd:string  

> *Rob Sanderson:* > "label": {"@language": "en", "@value": "english label"}

**Gregg Kellogg:** and if you used an object, it would be a language object  

**Rob Sanderson:** well, you could also use a value object  
… I've no problem putting the predefined terms in a separate file  

**Benjamin Young:** yeah...it all runs into conflict with somebody somewhere  
… and seems best avoided  
… other than the prefixes  

**Rob Sanderson:** so, how about 2 files  
… prefixes  
… aliases & terms  
… you can then import them into your context  
… you'd still get the benefit of context caching  

**Benjamin Young:** This is for context authors as a starter kit  
… as newbies will just mess things up, and they need to define their own terms in a context anyway  
… can already just pull in schema.org.  

**Harold Solbrig:** yeah, I wonder when you were talking about heavily cached  
… many of these are already added into libraries anyhow  
… and so these URLs would just be ignored and ultimately just mapped to what's hard coded--assuming the mappings are the same  

**Benjamin Young:** exactly. that's "heavy" caching :)  

**Ivan Herman:** the reason I'm a bit hesitant  
… is that if I'm going to use JSON-LD in a heavy way, then I'd avoid the aliases  
… but things like `describedby` or `label`, I'd use those  
… but if they're mixed into the aliases, I wouldn't use them  
… and if we make 3 files...we'd look ridiculous...  
… but the prefixes stuff I'd use often  
… and for me, I'd expect that it's there and I could use that more easily  
… but then...I am not the target here  

**Rob Sanderson:** one of the benefit of the existing prefixes in the list is that most of them are not terms  
… but `schema` is another potential conflict  
… which is why some communities have used `sdo`  
… so we could defer the terms and aliases discussion--pulling them out from the prefixes  
… and then we can focus on the prefix names and list  

**Gregg Kellogg:** ivan will remember how familiar this all sounds  

**Ivan Herman:** yes. and at some point we'll conflict with someone  
… so it starts to feel fruitless  
… so my feeling is, we tried...let's move on  

**Harold Solbrig:** the question on why bother  
… many of these are so common, that if we don't bother, it's going to get done anyway...and be done multiple different ways  

**Ivan Herman:** but maybe that's a good thing  
… your community will make a bunch of prefixes for the medical domain  
… that the publishing community won't care about  
… and vice versa  

**Harold Solbrig:** but then there's the common set of prefixes that we all care about  

**Ivan Herman:** but that's like 5 things  
… xsd, rdfs, and that's about it  

**Gregg Kellogg:** and JSON people won't use any of those  

**Ivan Herman:** right...so I propose to stop the exercise  

**Benjamin Young:** There is a context file which is the rdfa initial context. We reference in Wiley  
… the prefix list already exists and already a context in use  
… perhaps we just need to take that list  

**Ivan Herman:** a practical problem  

**Benjamin Young:** Oh?  

**Ivan Herman:** If I'm not around, no one will maintain it  

**Benjamin Young:** We should fix that  

**Ivan Herman:** We can pull into GH and make a redirect from the old URL, then people can maintain it in the future  

**Harold Solbrig:** prefix.cc ?  

**Benjamin Young:** No that's community, and more about the right hand side because communities move things around  

**Harold Solbrig:** The list?  

> *Benjamin Young:* [https://www.w3.org/2011/rdfa-context/rdfa-1.1](https://www.w3.org/2011/rdfa-context/rdfa-1.1)

> *Benjamin Young:* [http://www.w3.org/2013/json-ld-context/rdfa11](http://www.w3.org/2013/json-ld-context/rdfa11)

**Benjamin Young:** A lot of graph related tools just use this  

**Ivan Herman:** Some unnecessary things  

**Benjamin Young:** Yes but heavily cached so no cost  
… maintenance group would take over the maintenance of the rdfa core initial context  

**Ivan Herman:** So it goes into a repo, with a redirection in w3c space into this one

{: .proposed_resolution}

> *Ivan Herman:* +1

> *Gregg Kellogg:* +1

> *Benjamin Young:* +1

> *Rob Sanderson:* +1

> *Harold Solbrig:* +1

**Gregg Kellogg:** if we take over this work, and point it to the github repo, then we should be in a better place  
… something we can maintain without a staff contact  
… and potentially use some automation to automate the maintenance of this  

**Ivan Herman:** true for the JSON-LD context, but maybe not for the RDFa stuff  

**Benjamin Young:** I'd like to talk about the RDFa stuff separately  

> ***Resolution #4: JSON-LD Maintenance Group to take over the RDFa Initial Context work and maintain it and it's context file via GitHub***
{: #resolution4 .resolution}

**Ivan Herman:** maybe what we can do is also bring into this repo the RDFa stuff, and it's maintained in the same place  
… ok?
